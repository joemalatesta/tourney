 the way this works is during the season players are rated on their games won and lost. they start as a lvl 50 
 when you win a match you go up one rank point and down one point when you lose.
 to find the match race to win you take both players ranks and find the difference between them 
 ex player 1 rank 65 and player 2 rank 45
 the difference is 20 then using the chart below find the person with the highest ranking chart
 in the example player 1 is 65. you would go to the 3rd chart.
 find the range that the difference falls into (20) and find the game race
 in our example it would be the third range 19-29 therefore it will be a 5:3 race the higher ranked player would be the first number of games and lower ranked player second number of games
in our example Player 1 will need to win 5 games to player 2s 3 games
